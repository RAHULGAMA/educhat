    <p style="color: rgb(18, 17, 17); font-size: 17px; font-family: Times New Roman, Times, serif;">
        The full form of <b>BTech</b> is <b>Bachelor of Technology (BTech)</b>. BTech is a highly sought-after undergraduate engineering degree, offering a gateway to diverse and rewarding career opportunities in the ever-evolving technological landscape. India produces more than 10 lakh engineering graduates every year and the engineering education in India comprises around 2,500 engineering colleges and 1,300 polytechnic colleges. Moreover, BTech courses encompass a broad spectrum of engineering disciplines, ranging from traditional fields like BTech in Computer Science Engineering, Civil Engineering and Mechanical Engineering to emerging domains like artificial intelligence and robotics.

<br>For BTech admissions 2024, the most common <b>BTech entrance examinations</b> are JEE Main and JEE Advanced. Along with these national-level entrance examinations, there are many state and private-level entrance examinations that the students can attempt for admission to the course. <b>The basic eligibility criteria for BTech is Class 12 with Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics</b>. However, there are additional criteria in every entrance exam and institute. Some of the institutes also conduct admission to their courses on merit basis i.e. based on marks scored by candidates in their class 12 board exams. Top BTech colleges such as Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and National Institutes of Technology (NITs) are the pinnacle of engineering education in India, attracting the brightest minds with their rigorous academic programs and industry-aligned curricula.

<br>The job prospects for BTech graduates are highly impressive across every domain. Some of the top B recruiters in India are TATA Consultancy, IBM Global Services, Accenture Services and HCL Technologies.
